My name is Peter Hammond,  I am a follower of Jesus Christ and an evangelist through the gifting of the Holy Sprit.

One of the most important cammands of our King and Savior Jesus Christ is to go and preach the gospel:
Mark 16:15 HCSB Then He said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation. 

This leads us to the very next really important point.  What is the Gospel?

After research, biblical review, and reviewing with my Pastor Osman who helped me boil down to these two scriptures for guidance.
Bottom line:  If you don't include these points in your proclamation of the gospel, your not sharing the gospel.  

1 Corinthians 15:3-4 HCSB For I passed on to you as most important what I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that He was buried, that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,

Mark 1:15 HCSB “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the good news!”
